   Jabur And Songs

## Getting Started

The project directory is located at ./src. Please use Node.js version 20.8.0. Java 17 is required (for Android development) and use only npm package manager. Follow the instructions below:

### Step 1: Install npm packages

Install all required npm packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Then, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see Jabur and Songs app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

Due to the project's reliance on older versions of certain packages, there is a potential for build errors or issues during app launch. We are actively working to update these dependencies to mitigate these risks
